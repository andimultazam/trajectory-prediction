\begin{acknowledgments}
First, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Professor Stephane Bressan for his patience, encouragement, and advise throughout the project which is surely useful for my life afterwards. This project would not have been possible without his help and guidance.

Besides my supervisor, many thanks are given to my mentor, Remmy Zein, for a great discussion and guidance. Credit is also given to Thomas Kister, the main developer behind the web liancheng.data.science whom I get insight a lot from about the AIS end-to-end system.

At last, I would like to thank my wife for her support and love during the juggle between work and study. This project would have been more difficult without her assistance. You and our incoming baby are the reason that keep me motivated to complete this project.
