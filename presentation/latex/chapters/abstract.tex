With the current position as a leading maritime capital in the world, security is becoming a top priority for Singapore to develop analytic technology and intelligence in the maritime sector. The application varies from vessel tracking, trajectory prediction, to vessel monitoring and surveillance. Automatic Identification System (AIS) enables us to track vessel movement by receiving their records through a transponder device. The work in this project focuses on two parts; first to develop a standard exploratory data analysis for movement data. This is achieved by utilizing some of the techniques and tools specifically built to handle trajectory data. Secondly, to develop a prediction model to understand the future movement of the vessel given the history of AIS information. A trajectory prediction model based on Long Short Term Memory is designed, implemented, and tested on 1-month AIS data. The result suggests that the LSTM model works best at predicting 30 timestep into the future by using recursive multi-step prediction methods that utilize a shorter timestep model.
